d down <files>
Downloads latest versions of upstream files that are strictly more recent
than downstream, asking for confirmation when trying to overwrite.
Options:
  -overwrite ask|yes|no|up|back (default: no)
   (up means "upload ours as other version before overwriting")
   (back means "make a backup")
  -newer-than <time>
  -older-than <time>
  -only-create (only download files we don't have)
  -only-update (only download files we do have)
